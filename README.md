* Writing the data in a file in a directory
* Inserting the data in a SQL database
* Inserting the data in a NoSQL database
* Using CI tool
* Fixing the style in the modules
* Putting classes with the tests in *tests* package and classes with no tests in *src* package, where there are only the classes without the tests


### Next

In this section I list the next modify of the project code


### Running

In this section I list the actual modify of the project code that are not completed

* Declare the file and directory structure of the project

### Past

In this section I list the past modifies of the project code that are successufully completed

* Writing the file *Contribuing* like [this](https://gist.github.com/PurpleBooth/b24679402957c63ec426/forks)
